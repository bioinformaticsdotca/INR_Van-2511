He holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science and an M.Sc. in Statistics. Rodolfo is passionate about data analysis and information extraction. He is also dedicated to teaching data science to individuals from diverse backgrounds, as he believes that different perspectives lead to varied questions about problems, ultimately enhancing our ability to extract more information from the data. Ido Hatam Principal investigator Langara College Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada — ihatam@langara.ca Dr. Ido Hatam holds a PhD in microbiology and biotechnology from the University of Alberta and serves as an Instructor in the Department of Biology and Bioinformatics program at Langara College, where he is also a Principal Investigator at the College’s Applied Research Center. Dr. Hatam has developed multiple courses for the College’s Bioinformatics program focused on using R-based tools to analyze high-throughput biological data. His research group uses bioinformatics tools to construct and analyze synthetic microbial communities, and specializes in “Guerrilla Bioinformatics” - generating value-added knowledge through meta-analysis of large, publicly available biological datasets. Gareth Tang Gareth Tang graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in bioinformatics from Langara College in 2025. In his final year of studies, he collaborated with his fellow graduates to implement and benchmark a pipeline performing metagenomics assembly and annotation. In doing so, his cohort was able to apply the R programming skills and knowledge of bioinformatics tools they had developed during the program. Mike Wu PhD Student UBC Vancouver, BC — mikewu@langara.ca Mike Wu is a recent graduate from Langara College with a Bachelor of Science in Bioinformatics. He is now doing his graduate studies at UBC in bioinformatics (specialized in machine learning in metabolomics). Mike has hands-on experience in a couple of bioinformatics projects, including single-cell RNA seq pipeline, metagenomics assembly and annotation, and blastInR package development, where R programming is mainly used for app development, data analysis, and pipeline construction. Gavin Ieong Richmond, BC, Canada Gavin Ieong is a recent graduate in the Bachelor’s of Bioinformatics Program at Langara College. During his studies, he contributed to projects at the college’s Applied Research Centre, applying his background in biology and machine learning to real-world biological problems.
