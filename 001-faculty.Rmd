Gareth Tang graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in bioinformatics from Langara College in 2025. In his final year of studies, he collaborated with his fellow graduates to implement and benchmark a pipeline performing metagenomics assembly and annotation. In doing so, his cohort was able to apply the R programming skills and knowledge of bioinformatics tools they had developed during the program.
